	abstract = {We present a new support vector machine ({SVM})-based approach to predict the substrate specificity of subtypes of a given protein sequence family. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on the example of aryl acid-activating and amino acid-activating adenylation domains (A domains) of nonribosomal peptide synthetases ({NRPS}). The residues of gramicidin synthetase A that are 8 A around the substrate amino acid and corresponding positions of other adenylation domain sequences with 397 known and unknown specificities were extracted and used to encode this physico-chemical fingerprint into normalized real-valued feature vectors based on the physico-chemical properties of the amino acids. The {SVM} software package {SVM}(light) was used for training and classification, with transductive {SVMs} to take advantage of the information inherent in unlabeled data. Specificities for very similar substrates that frequently show cross-specificities were pooled to the so-called composite specificities and predictive models were built for them. The reliability of the models was confirmed in cross-validations and in comparison with a currently used sequence-comparison-based method. When comparing the predictions for 1230 {NRPS} A domains that are currently detectable in {UniProt}, the new method was able to give a specificity prediction in an additional 18\% of the cases compared with the old method. For 70\% of the sequences both methods agreed, for {\textless}6\% they did not, mainly on low-confidence predictions by the existing method. None of the predictive methods could infer any specificity for 2.4\% of the sequences, suggesting completely new types of specificity.},

	doi = {10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320293},
	abstract = {In recent years, numerous protein weight matrices have been developed that include physical characteristics of proteins, such as local sequence-structure information, alpha-helix information, secondary structure information and solvent accessibility states. These protein weight matrices are shown to have generally improved protein sequence alignments over classical protein weight matrices, like Point Accepted Mutation ({PAM}), Blocks of Amino Acid Substitution ({BLOSUM}), and {GONNET} matrices, where important limitations have been observe in recent works. In this paper, a novel protein weight matrix is constructed and presented. This protein weight matrix is not considered based on the mutation rate, like {PAM} or {BLOSUM} matrices, but on the physicochemical properties of each amino acid. In the literature, over 500 amino acid indices exist, each one representing a unique biological protein feature. For this study, 25 amino acid indices were selected. These amino acid indices represent general and widely accepted features of the amino acids. By using the proposed protein weight matrix the following advantages can be obtained compared to the classical protein weight matrices. The proposed protein weight matrix is not biased to specific groups of protein sequences as the values are calculated from the amino acid indices, and not from the protein sequences. Additionally, for the proposed protein weight matrix, the same matrix can be considered regardless of the protein sequence's homology to be aligned or the mutation rate presented. A correlation to the physical characterisations of the amino acids that the protein weight matrix derived from can be achieved. Different similarity matrices can be generated when different physical characterisations of amino acids are considered.},

	abstract = {The increasing number and diversity of protein sequence families requires new methods to define and predict details regarding function. Here, we present a method for analysis and prediction of functional sub-types from multiple protein sequence alignments. Given an alignment and set of proteins grouped into sub-types according to some definition of function, such as enzymatic specificity, the method identifies positions that are indicative of functional differences by comparison of sub-type specific sequence profiles, and analysis of positional entropy in the alignment. Alignment positions with significantly high positional relative entropy correlate with those known to be involved in defining sub-types for nucleotidyl cyclases, protein kinases, lactate/malate dehydrogenases and trypsin-like serine proteases. We highlight new positions for these proteins that suggest additional experiments to elucidate the basis of specificity. The method is also able to predict sub-type for unclassified sequences. We assess several variations on a prediction method, and compare them to simple sequence comparisons. For assessment, we remove close homologues to the sequence for which a prediction is to be made (by a sequence identity above a threshold). This simulates situations where a protein is known to belong to a protein family, but is not a close relative of another protein of known sub-type. Considering the four families above, and a sequence identity threshold of 30 \%, our best method gives an accuracy of 96 \% compared to 80 \% obtained for sequence similarity and 74 \% for {BLAST}. We describe the derivation of a set of sub-type groupings derived from an automated parsing of alignments from {PFAM} and the {SWISSPROT} database, and use this to perform a large-scale assessment. The best method gives an average accuracy of 94 \% compared to 68 \% for sequence similarity and 79 \% for {BLAST}. We discuss implications for experimental design, genome annotation and the prediction of protein function and protein intra-residue distances.},

From an evolutionary perspective, robust stability of proteins improves their biological fitness and allows for further optimization. Viewed from an industrial perspective, enzyme stability is crucial for the practical application of enzymes under the required reaction conditions. In this review, we analyze bioinformatic-driven strategies that are used to predict structural changes that can be applied to wild type proteins in order to produce more stable variants. The most commonly employed techniques can be classified into stochastic approaches, empirical or systematic rational design strategies, and design of chimeric proteins. We conclude that bioinformatic analysis can be efficiently used to study large protein superfamilies systematically as well as to predict particular structural changes which increase enzyme stability. Evolution has created a diversity of protein properties that are encoded in genomic sequences and structural data. Bioinformatics has the power to uncover this evolutionary code and provide a reproducible selection of hotspots - key residues to be mutated in order to produce more stable and functionally diverse proteins and enzymes. Further development of systematic bioinformatic procedures is needed to organize and analyze sequences and structures of proteins within large superfamilies and to link them to function, as well as to provide knowledge-based predictions for experimental evaluation.},

A systematic study of the corresponding adaptive mutations provides a key to one of the most challenging problems of modern structural biology - understanding the impact of amino acid substitutions on protein function. The subfamily-specific positions ({SSPs}) are conserved within functional subfamilies but are different between them and, therefore, seem to be responsible for functional diversity in protein superfamilies. Consequently, a corresponding method to perform the bioinformatic analysis of sequence and structural data has to be implemented in the common laboratory practice to study the structure-function relationship in proteins and develop novel protein engineering strategies. This paper describes Zebra web server - a powerful remote platform that implements a novel bioinformatic analysis algorithm to study diverse protein families. It is the first application that provides specificity determinants at different levels of functional classification, therefore addressing complex functional diversity of large superfamilies. Statistical analysis is implemented to automatically select a set of highly significant {SSPs} to be used as hotspots for directed evolution or rational design experiments and analyzed studying the structure-function relationship.

	abstract = {Background
Functionally relevant artificial or natural mutations are difficult to assess or predict if no structure-function information is available for a protein. This is especially important to correctly identify functionally significant non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms ({nsSNPs}) or to design a site-directed mutagenesis strategy for a target protein. A new and powerful methodology is proposed to guide these two decision strategies, based only on conservation rules of physicochemical properties of amino acids extracted from a multiple alignment of a protein family where the target protein belongs, with no need of explicit structure-function relationships.

Results
A statistical analysis is performed over each amino acid position in the multiple protein alignment, based on different amino acid physical or chemical characteristics, including hydrophobicity, side-chain volume, charge and protein conformational parameters. The variances of each of these properties at each position are combined to obtain a global statistical indicator of the conservation degree of each property. Different types of physicochemical conservation are defined to characterize relevant and irrelevant positions. The differences between statistical variances are taken together as the basis of hypothesis tests at each position to search for functionally significant mutable sites and to identify specific mutagenesis targets. The outcome is used to statistically predict physicochemical consensus sequences based on different properties and to calculate the amino acid propensities at each position in a given protein. Hence, amino acid positions are identified that are putatively responsible for function, specificity, stability or binding interactions in a family of proteins. Once these key functional positions are identified, position-specific statistical distributions are applied to divide the 20 common protein amino acids in each position of the protein's primary sequence into a group of functionally non-disruptive amino acids and a second group of functionally deleterious amino acids.

Conclusions
With this approach, not only conserved amino acid positions in a protein family can be labeled as functionally relevant, but also non-conserved amino acid positions can be identified to have a physicochemically meaningful functional effect. These results become a discriminative tool in the selection and elaboration of rational mutagenesis strategies for the protein. They can also be used to predict if a given {nsSNP}, identified, for instance, in a genomic-scale analysis, can have a functional implication for a particular protein and which {nsSNPs} are most likely to be functionally silent for a protein. This analytical tool could be used to rapidly and automatically discard any irrelevant {nsSNP} and guide the research focus toward functionally significant mutations. Based on preliminary results and applications, this technique shows promising performance as a valuable bioinformatics tool to aid in the development of new protein variants and in the understanding of function-structure relationships in proteins.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many pharmacologically important peptides are synthesized nonribosomally by multimodular peptide synthetases ({NRPSs}). These enzyme templates consist of iterated modules that, in their number and organization, determine the primary structure of the corresponding peptide products. At the core of each module is an adenylation domain that recognizes the cognate substrate and activates it as its aminoacyl adenylate. Recently, the crystal structure of the phenylalanine-activating adenylation domain {PheA} was solved with phenylalanine and {AMP}, illustrating the structural basis for substrate recognition.
{RESULTS}: By comparing the residues that line the phenylalanine-binding pocket in {PheA} with the corresponding moieties in other adenylation domains, general rules for deducing substrate specificity were developed. We tested these in silico 'rules' by mutating specificity-conferring residues within {PheA}. The substrate specificity of most mutants was altered or relaxed. Generalization of the selectivity determinants also allowed the targeted specificity switch of an aspartate-activating adenylation domain, the crystal structure of which has not yet been solved, by introducing a single mutation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In silico studies and structure-function mutagenesis have defined general rules for the structural basis of substrate recognition in adenylation domains of {NRPSs}. These rules can be used to rationally alter the specificity of adenylation domains and to predict from the primary sequence the specificity of biochemically uncharacterized adenylation domains. Such efforts could enhance the structural diversity of peptide antibiotics such as penicillins, cyclosporins and vancomycins by allowing synthesis of 'unnatural' natural products.},
