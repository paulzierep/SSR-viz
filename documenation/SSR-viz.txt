    Protein families can often be further divide into functional diverse
    subfamilies. Each subfamily posses very specific functions which
    distinguishes them from each other. Examples are substrate specificity,
    protein-protein interaction or different reaction types. In many cases
    these functions are based on a limited set of residues. Therefore, to
    understand the protein diversity, the identification of those residues
    is crucial. In order to support researchers in this task we developed a
    toolbox which allows to detect and visualize those residues, based on a
    multiple sequence alignment of proteins with experimental validated
    functionality.

Getting started
===============

The SSR-viz algorithm is based on a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
file in FASTA format, which can be generated with various tools, such as
Clustalo and Mafft or with a Webserver such as ().

The topic of sequence alignment is beyond the scope of this manual.
Nevertheless one should keep in mind that the quality of the alignment
is crucial for the detection algorithm. (Is is difficult to interpret
the importance of a position, which has more gaps then amino acids.)

The first step is the classification of the sequences into subfamilies.
This is undoubtedly the most difficult part, as it often requires to
identify the specific functionality based on scientific literature or
even undertake experimental validation.

Dedicated databases such as can help to identify protein function.

Even though there are various tools available that can cluster protein
sequences, these clustering methods always apply some kind of similarity
scoring, which leads in most cases to a clustering based on evolutionary
relationship rather then functional similarity. This is demonstrated on
an example in subsection \[example\].

Ones you collected the class information of your sequences you can add
them to your alignement. The **CSV\_Builder** tool allows to creates a
comma seperated value (CSV) file which can be used to add the class
label to the sequences (see \[csv\_b\]).

An alignemnt and the CSV file is everything thats needed to detect
subfamily specific residues in the sequences. The **SSR\_plot** tool
handles the actual execution of the detection algorithm (see \[\])
