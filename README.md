Abstract
=====================

Homologous proteins can be classified into protein families. The members of a family share a similar structure and sequence. Despite their inherent similarity, individual members of the same family can adopt very specific functions, leading to a further division into subfamilies. These functional differences can often be assigned to specific residues. This information can be used for various applications, such as function-based subfamily classification, rational site-directed mutagenesis and general elucidation of mechanisms of action. Here we introduce a novel user-friendly open-source software which allows for the identification and visualization of these residues.
